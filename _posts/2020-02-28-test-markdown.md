I was wonder if the accepted age of the universe is trust-worthy. I decided to take it upon myself to explore the validity of the value. The universe we live in isn't flat and it keep expanding, known as redshift. The universe contains billions of galaxies, each galaxies contains miliions of stars.  I started by collecting valuable data/information. I order to caculate the age of the universe, I needed to collect: 

**Here is some bold text**

## Here is a secondary heading

Here's a useless table:

| Galaxy Name | Modulus Distance | Recession Velocity |
| :------ |:--- | :--- |
| UGC12914 | 33.49 | 4522.0 |
| PGC000143	 | 24.94 | -54.0 |
| NGC7814 | 30.80	 | 1204.0 |
| UGC00014 | 35.03 | 7428.0 |

Base on this information, I was able to deduce it

It can also be centered!

Here's a code chunk:

~~~
var foo = function(x) {
  return(x + 5);
}
foo(3)
~~~

And here is the same code with syntax highlighting:

```javascript
var foo = function(x) {
  return(x + 5);
}
foo(3)
```

And here is the same code yet again but with line numbers:

{% highlight javascript linenos %}
var foo = function(x) {
  return(x + 5);
}
foo(3)
{% endhighlight %}
