My name is Phuong Tran and I am a data scientist I have the following qualities:

- Bachelor of Science in Computer Science (class of 2022)
- I love to think of myself as a very hardworking person. I don’t back down from challenges and my thirst for knowledge is my driving force. Whenever I am faced with an obstacle, I know that my perseverance will triumph over that obstacle.
- Active Listener: I have always displayed a careful approach to learning by actively listen and asking questions.
- A passion for Improvement: My efforts to improve and to do better the "second time around" is always a top priority. I am willing to put in extra time and effort to meet a deadline of any project I am assigned.

### My history

I begin my interest first in computer science with a simple "Hello World". I used to think that coding was hard. Once I learned it, I couldn't stop learning more. I love the idea of creating something all by myself. I was particularly good at Math. Because of this, I was recommended by a friend to look into data analysis. I immediately fell in love with it. Using data to answer everyday questions and behavior was so much fun for me. I often take a data set and just try to understand as much as I can about it. I created graphic representations to really understand the data set. Most recently, I used a data set that has the angular velocity of galaxies as well as its distance from Earth to find out the age of the universe as well as the Hubble constant. I love to see how close I get to the actual value. I am fascinated at the capability of what data analysis could do. I wanted to create something that is similar to google suggesting something you should look at. Seeing google recommends something that I actually need fascinates me while it scares other people. I’m fascinated because of the fact that there are so many data sets that could potentially help me understand everything about the world.
